<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Exploratory Data Analysis and Journey in Neurocritical Care is a project that delves deep into the analysis of EEG data to understand brain activity in critical care scenarios.

### What is EEG?

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method used to record electrical activity in the brain. Learn more about EEG [here](#what-is-eeg).

### How Spectrograms are Related to EEG?

Spectrograms play a crucial role in analyzing EEG data. Find out more about their relationship [here](#how-spectrograms-are-related-to-eeg).

### LPD/GPD/LRDA/GRDA Conditions

Explore various brain conditions such as Lateralized Periodic Discharges (LPDs), Generalized Periodic Discharges (GPDs), Lateralized Rhythmic Delta Activity (LRDA), and Generalized Rhythmic Delta Activity (GRDA) [here](#lpd-gpd-lrda-grda-conditions).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
